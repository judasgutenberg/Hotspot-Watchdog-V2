# Hotspot-Watchdog-V2
This version attempts to log every time it restarts the Moxee hotspot, using NTP to timestamp these events (since the ESP8266 has internet but no real time clock).


This will eventually have a different backend. For now, only the watchdog.ino file is different.

(Disparaging remarks removed; the wires hadn't been connected!)

Yikes it really does seem broken now.
